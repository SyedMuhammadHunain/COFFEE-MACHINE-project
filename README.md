#### COFFEE-MACHINE-project
I've made a program to control a coffee machine

#### FEATURES
* Firstly, ask you which type of coffee do you want Black or White coffee [B/b] / [W/w]
* Then, asks you about manual or double cup size [M/m] / [D/d]
* For manual cup size (takes normal time) and for double cup size (increases the 50 % baking time) in each step
* Displays you the operations needed to make a selected coffee
* It also calculates the time takes to make a coffee
* No ERROR handling
